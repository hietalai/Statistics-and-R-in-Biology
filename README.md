Welcome! 

This interactive literature is created with a mix of R Markdown, ****bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and **Shiny** (https://shiny.rstudio.com/). 

Download the repository and first open up the .Rproj project file in RStudio and then open `index.Rmd`. Using the *Build Book* tool, you should be able to build the entire book after installing the required packages listed in the Rmd-file.
